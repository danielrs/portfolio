I am a **Software engineer** with a strong focus on **user experience**, performance, and scalability. My favorite programming language is **Go**, but I like to think that software development is about good design, and using the best tool to solve the problem at hand . During my free time I like to contribute to open-source projects and attend Hackathons.
