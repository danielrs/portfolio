What is the best programming language someone should learn in order to be a ~~good~~ happy programmer?
<!--more-->

That's the question that I made myself plenty of times when I was learning how to program. I started out with *C++*, and eventually moved to *Java*, since it was way more common in enterprise setups. Then, most of my friends started toying with *Python* for web development (Django was becoming popular during that time), and so did I. After that, I started learning *C#* in order to use *Unity* and make some games.

At some point, I grew tired of conventional programming languages. None of those that most people used was fun, **they were mostly the same**, and with good reason.

During my academic years I heard good (and bad) things about more esoteric programming languages. I thought that it couldn't be so bad, so I decided to go head first and try something new. That's how I became familiar with creatures such as *Haskell*, *Clojure*, *Scala*, and *Elixir*. They were good, they were **different**, but at the end of the day, they were still programming languages.

## The revelation
**Programming was still programming**, it didn't matter if I used and *Object Oriented Language*, or a *Functional* language. Sure, they were different in their way of doing things, but the underlying logic was still the same.

That's when it hit me: **there's no best programming language**, only tools. My perceptions of what a programmer should be, was changed. We are supposed to be problem solvers, not dictionaries. In general, we take a problem, we analyze it, and only then we decided what to use to take care of the problem; and believe me, problems are **much easier too solve** if we analyze it first, that's the way we should do it, and in fact, there's dozens of methodologies for making software that follow this approach.

### So, how to be a happy programmer?
I have found that what works best for most people, even if it sounds obvious, is to do what they love in their spare time (even better if you work doing what you love!).

* Do you work for a company that uses *Java*, but you love to make games in Unity? Then, make games in your spare time.

* Do you work as a full-stack web developer but wish to become a low-level systems programmer? Play around with *C*, *C++*, or *Rust* and make some apps; a new job doing what you love could be around the corner.

An extra (but **important**) tip: don't neglect the theory behind programming in general. From the top of my head these are the topics I can think of:

* Graph theory
* Algorithm analysis
* Set theory
* Probability
* Statistics
* Linear Algebra

Why? Those concepts are present in all programming languages, and they are gonna be useful for the rest of our career.
