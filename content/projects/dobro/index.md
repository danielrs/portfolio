Dobro is a terminal-client for streaming music from Pandora. The client lets you log-in, create, update, edit and play Pandora stations from the terminal. Here's a quick demo of the app in action:

## Development

Rust is a good systems programming language, however, it lacks the diversity of libraries that some more established languages like *C++* have. For instance, most of the app functionalities where developed using plain Rust, with the exception of audio playback and audio decoding; which where handled by the native libraries [ffmpeg][ffmpeg] and [ao][ao] respectively.
